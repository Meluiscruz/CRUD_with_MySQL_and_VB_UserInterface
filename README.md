# CRUD_with_MySQL_and_VB_UserInterface

This UI was coded with Visual Basic, using Visual Studio 2019. This Interface performs basic operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
on a Table, which is stored in a Data Base managed with MySQL.

### Special thanks to [Aroldo Pinto](aspp2583@gmail.com "Aroldo's email"), who is the original creator of the project, made and shared the 
[video-tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh-p8A4CZf0&t=1s "CRUD VB MYSQL") to develop and deploy the UI.
